The extension is designed exclusively for all personnel including employees, consultants, contractors of both Plume and Plume Health Medical Group ("you" or "your", collectively "Plume personnel") and is not available to the general public. This policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your information in connection with the extension and is intended to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Google Chrome Store's requirements.

### 1.1 Information We Collect

#### 1.1.a Authentication Data
To verify your identity and maintain security, we collect authentication data, including but not limited to usernames, password hashes, and security tokens. This information is essential for granting access and ensuring that the extension and its functionalities are exclusively used by authorized Plume personnel.

#### 1.1.b Access Logs
In accordance with HIPAA regulations, we log access to the extension to monitor usage and safeguard against unauthorized access. These logs include date, time, user identification, and the nature of the accessed information.

#### 1.1.c Browser Paths
The extension requires access to the hostnames and paths of the websites you visit while using the browser. This information enables us to determine when to show the extension based on the third-party tools you are using.

### 1.2 Use of Information
We use the collected information to:

- Verify user identity and authorize access.
- Log access for security audits and compliance with HIPAA and other regulatory requirements.
- Enhance the extension's functionality by determining its availability on certain hostnames.

### 1.3 Information Sharing and Disclosure
We do not share or disclose any collected information with third parties, except as required by law or to comply with legal processes. Access to the information is strictly limited to authorized Plume personnel who need the information to perform their job functions related to the maintenance and operation of the extension.

### 1.4 Data Protection
